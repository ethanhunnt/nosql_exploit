# nosql_exploit
This module is for folks who want to exploit NoSQL Injection.

How to Use the Updated Tool:
Create the Headers File (headers.json):

json
{
  "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Authorization": "Bearer some_token"
}
Create the Data File (data.json):

json
{
  "userId": "12345",
  "password": "password123"
}
Run the Tool:

For POST requests:



python nosqli_exploit.py -m POST -u "https://example.com/api/login" -d "data.json" -H "headers.json" -t "userId" -p "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
For GET requests:


python nosqli_exploit.py -m GET -u "https://example.com/api/get_user" -d "data.json" -H "headers.json" -t "userId" -p "http://127.0.0.1:8080"

Conclusion:
The tool now uses more advanced payloads, including nested object injection, array injection, $size checks, field extraction, and blind time-based attacks.
The payloads are designed to bypass typical filters, exploit deeper NoSQL-specific logic, and test edge cases.
Make sure to test these payloads across various parameters, especially in situations where the database might be filtering or validating input in unexpected ways.
